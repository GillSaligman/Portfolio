					<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
					<p>LuMAR is a fully modular robotic arm system designed for lunar base maintenance. Developed for the NASA RASC-AL competition, it features a 7-DOF arm, custom gripper, and autonomous control over Wi-Fi. The entire system is modular by design — only 4 wires run up the arm (24V, GND, 3.3V, GND), powering custom PCBs and individual ESP32 microcontrollers at each joint. Each joint runs independently and wirelessly communicates with a Raspberry Pi on the chassis, which in turn interfaces with a master controller. The result is a scalable, reliable system that eliminates integration bottlenecks and isolates faults.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Project Highlights</h3>
					<div class="image"><img src="" alt="Team with robot" /></div>
					<p>Our system architecture allows future students to scale or swap joints easily. I personally led mechanical design, electronics spec development, prototyping, and coding — everything from torque calculations and part testing to 3D printing custom brackets that fit around 1x1 aluminum extrusion and developing firmware for each microcontroller.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Software and Control</h3>
					<div class="image"><img src="" alt="Software Diagram" /></div>
					<p>The robotic arm operates through ROS 2 nodes running on a laptop, which SSH into a Raspberry Pi on the bot. The Pi bridges communications to ESP32s via MQTT. Each ESP interprets joint commands, executes PID loops, and returns position feedback in real time. Control modes include direct manual input and Xbox controller-based velocity control. The laptop coordinates simulation and live debugging through Gazebo.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Electronics</h3>
					<p>I hand-wired every part of the system. The ESP32s were selected after testing multiple microcontrollers for Wi-Fi stability, analog support, pinout, firmware compatibility, and processing power. Every joint receives power only — no data lines — enabling a lightweight and highly modular electrical architecture.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Mechanical Design</h3>
					<p>The arm was designed around a hollow 1x1" aluminum backbone. I modeled and 3D printed all bracketry, drive enclosures, and joint mounts with PLA or ABS depending on strength and warping risk. Each part was iterated to minimize print failure and maximize rigidity. My torque calculations guided gear ratio selection and motor sizing.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Prototyping & Assembly</h3>
					<div class="image"><img src="" alt="Assembly Image" /></div>
					<div class="image"><img src="" alt="Assembly Image 2" /></div>
					<p>Our distributed architecture meant each joint could be tested in isolation before being added to the system. This eliminated integration bottlenecks and ensured that when joints came together, they worked immediately. I designed the joints to act like octopus arms: if one fails, the rest still work.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Takeaways & Future Work</h3>
					<div class="image"><img src="" alt="Final robot image" /></div>
					<p>We’re handing this project off to Drexel’s next class. Documentation, testing code, and CAD files are complete. Major next steps include drivetrain fixes, full battery operation, and completion of J1 and J2. This project showed me the power of modular systems and gave me end-to-end ownership over a real robotics platform.</p>
