          <h3 class="major section-space">Overview</h3>
          <p>This system is a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm mounted to a custom motorized chassis, built for the NASA RASC-AL competition. It demonstrates modularity, autonomy, and real-world engineering execution — every joint is independently controlled, wired, powered, and programmed.</p>
          <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('overviewDetails')">More Details</button>
          <div id="overviewDetails" class="details">
            <p>We brainstormed four concept directions: multifunctional bots, single-task bots, task-specialized swarms, and finally a modular swarm — which we chose. Our modular approach gives us scalable redundancy and resilience. Each joint is modular, powered with just 4 wires total running up the arm: HV +, HV −, LV +, LV −, reducing wiring complexity and increasing serviceability.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major section-space">Project Highlights</h3>
          <p>I was responsible for designing, prototyping, printing, wiring, and programming every aspect of the robotic arm. This includes calculating joint torques, testing dozens of microcontroller boards, developing embedded firmware in MicroPython, and building a Wi-Fi-based messaging system using MQTT across ESP32s, a Raspberry Pi, and a controller-hosting laptop.</p>
          <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('highlightDetails')">More Details</button>
          <div id="highlightDetails" class="details">
            <p>I tested numerous boards to find the ideal mix of analog pins, Wi-Fi reliability, and firmware support. Each joint has a self-contained system with power regulation, PID control, and regression-calibrated feedback. The mechanical design centers around 1x1 aluminum with custom 3D-printed clamping enclosures for modular swaps.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major section-space">Software & Control</h3>
          <p>The control system is distributed using ROS 2 and MQTT. A Raspberry Pi hosts the Wi-Fi network and bridges commands between the controller (via SSH) and the ESP32s embedded in each joint. The Xbox controller enables live input; control messages are formatted and relayed in real-time.</p>

          <div id="softwareDetails" class="details">
            <p>Each ESP32 listens for its own joint commands and publishes its angle feedback to MQTT. A Python simulation overlays real and target positions for debugging. ROS 2 nodes handle input, system state broadcasting, error reporting, and simulation in Gazebo.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major section-space">Electronics</h3>
          <p>Each joint receives only power. Logic, control, and feedback are embedded locally using ESP32s. The central Raspberry Pi provides wireless coordination. This modularity ensures a failure in one joint doesn’t impact the others.</p>
          <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('electronicsDetails')">More Details</button>
          <div id="electronicsDetails" class="details">
            <p>Boards were selected through trial and error — I tested dozens, evaluating firmware support, input/output pin counts, analog resolution, and reliability. I soldered and wired every joint myself, building custom power distribution from a 4-wire backbone.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major section-space">Mechanical Design</h3>
          <p>I designed the full arm structure using CAD, calculated torques, and selected drive motors. The parts were all 3D-printed and clamped around 1x1 aluminum tubing. The modular frame allows each joint to mount or dismount in minutes.</p>
          <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('mechanicalDetails')">More Details</button>
          <div id="mechanicalDetails" class="details">
            <p>The gearboxes were 3D printed and tested extensively. I accounted for thermal deformation and print tolerance when designing fits and mounting. Designs evolved to clamp around tubing instead of enclosing it, improving alignment and swap time.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major section-space">Prototyping & Assembly</h3>
          <p>Because the system was modular, integration was seamless. I verified each joint in isolation before integrating them into the full arm. This reduced risk and made debugging straightforward — no 'integration hell.'</p>
          <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('protoDetails')">More Details</button>
          <div id="protoDetails" class="details">
            <p>The modular system meant once a joint worked on the bench, it would work in the full build. I carefully managed wire routing, shielding, and power distribution. I also validated system integrity with full-chain simulation before field tests.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major section-space">Takeaways & Future Work</h3>
          <p>LuMAR is now left for future Drexel students to improve. I’m proud of the modularity, robustness, and expandability of this system. The biggest future step is finishing the drive system and adding battery power.</p>
          <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('takeawaysDetails')">More Details</button>
          <div id="takeawaysDetails" class="details">
            <p>Future steps include improving drive encoders, expanding the ROS 2 stack, adding 1st and 2nd joints for full base rotation, and documenting procedures for handoff. I’m confident the modularity and reliability foundation we built will support whatever comes next.</p>
