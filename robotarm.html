      <h2 class="section-title">OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p class="spaced">Inspired by NASA’s RASC-AL challenge, my senior design team created a lunar maintenance rover with a modular advanced manipulator, a custom chassis, and distributed control — built for adaptability, repairability, and upgradeability.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>This project was a test platform for modularity, control, and systems integration — not a hardened lunar system. Every element was designed with modularity in mind: only four wires (HV+/–, LV+/–) run from the chassis to the arm, distributing power to each joint’s independent controller. This minimized wiring complexity and enabled hot-swapping of components. While not space-grade, the prototype provided a hands-on validation environment for ideas in full-stack robotics.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="section-title">PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
      <img src="FullySeniorDesignRender.JPG" alt="Full arm render">
      <p class="spaced">I was team leader and led all mechanical, electrical, coding, prototyping, and testing work. The rest of the team focused on documentation and outreach, while I built and integrated the actual hardware and software systems.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>The concept was inspired by RASC-AL’s call for long-term lunar servicing platforms. We explored several directions before settling on a modular robotic arm mounted to a chassis. The arm’s modularity allows for easy upgrades and repairs — a feature that would be vital for years of service on the Moon. We decided to use ROS 2 to support autonomy and communication structure, and I built the entire stack to simulate real-world deployment.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">MECHANICAL DESIGN</h2>
      <img src="RobotArmRender.jpg" alt="Robot Arm Render">
      <p class="spaced">We started by analyzing different joint layouts to minimize singularities. I calculated all forces, moments, and required torques based on a desired payload and arm reach. Then, I designed and rapidly prototyped each joint one by one.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>The arm’s structure is built around a 1” x 1” aluminum tube spine, with each joint 3D-printed using PLA, PETG, or ABS depending on stress requirements.</p>
        <p>Joints are fully modular, each attaching independently to the central spine. I originally designed a 3D-printed harmonic drive to increase torque and reduce backlash, but it was cut due to time.</p>

        <img src="HarmoncDrivesidecross.png" alt="Harmonic Side View">
        <p>We completed J3–J6 + gripper before the deadline. Potentiometers were used for feedback and calibrated using regression. Torque estimates were done early using estimated motor weights, and our final motors stayed within bounds.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="section-title">SPECIAL NOTE ON J6 + GRIPPER</h2>
      <img src="j6gripcrosssection.png" alt="J6 Gripper Cross Section">
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>J6 was an axial joint, already tough to design — but we needed more than 270° rotation, so I geared down the potentiometer to achieve ~600° range. We used axial thrust bearings and radial bearings to fully constrain it, while keeping the entire joint hollow for wire passthrough to the servo-powered gripper.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">ELECTRONICS</h2>
      <img src="ArmWiringGrosspic.png" alt="Gross Wiring">
      <p class="spaced">Each joint has its own microcontroller, powered by a shared 4-wire snake (HV+/– and LV+/–). Joints can be added or removed with no changes to the system — they just tap into the same power line and connect to the existing wireless network.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Joint Electronics</summary>
        <p>After testing multiple options, we chose ESP8266s with analog input and Wi-Fi support that could run MicroPython. CircuitPython caused PID issues.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Chassis Electronics</summary>
        <p>The base includes hobbyist-grade electronics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>12V and 24V power supplies</li>
          <li>Buck converters for 5V and 3.3V</li>
          <li>Fuse protection</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi as command/control center</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">SOFTWARE & CONTROL</h2>
      <img src="RobotArmComsDiagram.png" alt="Software and Communication">
      <p class="spaced">The robot uses a distributed system with a Raspberry Pi hosting the network and relaying commands via MQTT to each joint. The Pi can operate in position or velocity mode depending on how the user wants to control the robot.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>The Pi uses hostapd, dnsmasq, and mosquitto. Commands can come from an Xbox controller (velocity) or terminal (position).</p>
        <p>ROS 2 was used for simulation, logging, and input/output — while MQTT handled real-time joint communication.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="section-title">COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL</h2>
      <img src="Dataexamplepic.png" alt="Data Example">
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>Message format: [DR, DL, J3, J4, J5, J6, G]</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Controller:</b> Xbox → PC → Pi, live float [-1,1]</li>
          <li><b>Velocity:</b> Sent as 'V0.65'</li>
          <li><b>Position:</b> User types 'j4 45' → 'P45.00'</li>
          <li><b>Actual:</b> ESP sends current value → Pi aggregates into full bracket</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <h2 class="section-title">ESP LOGIC</h2>
      <img src="j5 data pic.png" alt="J5 Logic">
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>Each ESP connects to the network, listens for its command, and:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Runs PID to a set angle (P)</li>
          <li>Or drives velocity (V) with boundary clamping</li>
          <li>Sends actual value back to the Pi</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <h2 class="section-title">PROTOTYPING & ASSEMBLY</h2>
      <p class="spaced">Because joints are fully independent, I could test and assemble each one individually — avoiding the classic “integration hell.”</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>We built from gripper backward. Each joint was wired, flashed, tuned, and tested independently, then mounted. Joint brackets were hot-swappable, and all wiring was internal for quick iteration.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="section-title">TAKEAWAYS & FUTURE WORK</h2>
      <p class="spaced">LuMAR is being passed on to future Drexel teams to serve as a platform for continued development and as a teaching tool for robotics and controls.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>Future work includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding J1/J2 to complete 7-DOF</li>
          <li>Improved drivetrain housing</li>
          <li>Swappable end-effectors</li>
          <li>Simulation + autonomy upgrades</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wrote full documentation and setup guides to help future teams build from where I left off.</p>
