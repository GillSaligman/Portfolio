          <h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
          <p>Inspired by NASA’s RASC-AL challenge, my senior design team created a lunar maintenance rover with a modular advanced manipulator, a custom chassis, and distributed control — built for adaptability, repairability, and upgradeability.</p>
          <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('overviewMore')">More Info</button>
          <div id="overviewMore" class="dropdown-content">
            <p>This project was a test platform for modularity, control, and systems integration — not a hardened lunar system. Every element was designed with modularity in mind: only four wires (HV+/–, LV+/–) run from the chassis to the arm, distributing power to each joint’s independent controller. This minimized wiring complexity and enabled hot-swapping of components. While not space-grade, the prototype provided a hands-on validation environment for ideas in full-stack robotics.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Project Highlights</h3>
          <img src="images/FullySeniorDesignRender.JPG" alt="Full system render" />
          <p>I was team leader and led all mechanical, electrical, coding, prototyping, and testing work. The rest of the team focused on documentation and outreach, while I built and integrated the actual hardware and software systems.</p>
          <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('highlightMore')">More Info</button>
          <div id="highlightMore" class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The concept was inspired by RASC-AL’s call for long-term lunar servicing platforms. We explored several directions before settling on a modular robotic arm mounted to a chassis. The arm’s modularity allows for easy upgrades and repairs — a feature that would be vital for years of service on the Moon. We decided to use ROS 2 to support autonomy and communication structure, and I built the entire stack to simulate real-world deployment.</p>

          </div>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Mechanical Design</h3>
          <img src="images/RobotArmRender.jpg" alt="Arm Render" />
          <p>We started by analyzing different joint layouts to minimize singularities. I calculated all forces, moments, and required torques based on a desired payload and arm reach. Then, I designed and rapidly prototyped each joint one by one.</p>
          <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('mechMore')">More Info</button>
          <div id="mechMore" class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The arm’s structure is built around a 1” x 1” aluminum tube spine, with each joint 3D-printed using PLA, PETG, or ABS depending on stress requirements. Joints are designed to be fully modular, each attaching independently to the central spine. I originally designed a 3D-printed harmonic drive to increase torque and reduce backlash, but it was cut due to time.</p>

            <img src="images/HarmonicDriveRender.png" />
            <img src="images/HarmoncDrivesidecross.png" />
            <p>We completed J3–J6 + gripper before the deadline. Potentiometers were used for joint feedback due to budget constraints, and we calibrated them ourselves using regression to convert resistance to angle.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Special Note on J6 + Gripper</h3>
          <img src="images/j6gripcrosssection.png" alt="Cross section of J6" />
          <p>J6 was an axial joint requiring more than 270° rotation, so I geared down the potentiometer to achieve ~600° range. We used axial and radial bearings to fully constrain it, while keeping the joint hollow for wire passthrough to the servo-powered gripper.</p>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Electronics</h3>
          <img src="images/ArmWiringGrosspic.png" />
          <p>Each joint has its own microcontroller, powered by a shared 4-wire snake (HV+/– and LV+/–). Joints can be added or removed with no changes to the system — they just tap into the same power line and connect to the existing wireless network.</p>

            <h4>Joint Electronics</h4>
            <img src="images/Joint eleectronics Diagram.png" />
            <p>Each joint contains:
              <ul>
                <li>ESP8266 microcontroller</li>
                <li>Potentiometer for angle feedback</li>
                <li>Motor driver + gearmotor</li>
              </ul>
              Joints connect to Wi-Fi, receive a target angle or velocity, run local PID loops, and send feedback via MQTT.
            </p>
            <h4>Chassis Electronics</h4>
            <img src="images/robotchassiselectronics.png" />
            <p>The chassis contains 12V/24V supplies, 5V/3.3V buck converters, fuse protection, and a Raspberry Pi which acts as the central hub.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Software & Control</h3>
          <img src="images/RobotArmComsDiagram.png" />
          <p>The robot uses a distributed system with a Raspberry Pi hosting the network and relaying commands via MQTT to each joint. The Pi can operate in position or velocity mode.</p>
          <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('swMore')">More Info</button>
          <div id="swMore" class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The Pi uses hostapd, dnsmasq, and mosquitto to run its own Wi-Fi network. ROS 2 is used for simulation and I/O, while MQTT handles real-time joint control. Input can come from a controller (velocity mode) or typed in (position mode).</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Communication Protocol</h3>
          <img src="images/Dataexamplepic.png" />
          <p>MQTT messages follow the format [DR, DL, J3, J4, J5, J6, G]. The Raspberry Pi interprets joystick/controller data or terminal commands and formats desired position or velocity messages.</p>

          <h3 class="major spacer">ESP Logic</h3>
          <img src="images/j5 data pic.png" />
          <p>Each ESP listens for its joint's value. If it’s 'P45.00', it runs PID to that angle. If it’s 'V0.65', it runs motor speed with soft stops. Feedback is sent back as current position.</p>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Prototyping & Assembly</h3>
          <p>Joints were tested and assembled independently. We began from the gripper and moved backward to avoid integration issues. Each joint was flashed and PID-tuned before mounting.</p>

          <h3 class="major spacer">Takeaways & Future Work</h3>
          <p>LuMAR is being handed off to future Drexel teams as a platform and teaching tool. Our advisor will use it to teach PID control. Future plans include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding J1/J2 for 7-DOF</li>
            <li>Improved drivetrain gearing</li>
            <li>End-effector swapping</li>
            <li>Full autonomy stack</li>
          </ul>
