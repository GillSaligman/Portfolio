				<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
				<p>Inspired by NASA’s RASC-AL challenge, my senior design team created a lunar maintenance rover with a modular advanced manipulator, a custom chassis, and distributed control — built for adaptability, repairability, and upgradeability.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>The project was a test platform for modularity, control, and systems integration — not a hardened lunar system. Every element was designed with modularity in mind: only four wires (HV+/–, LV+/–) run from the chassis to the arm, distributing power to each joint’s independent controller. This minimized wiring complexity and enabled hot-swapping of components.</p>
				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Project Highlights</h3>
				<img src="images/FullySeniorDesignRender.jpg" alt="Render of robotic arm on chassis">
				<p>I was team leader and led all mechanical, electrical, coding, prototyping, and testing work. The rest of the team focused on documentation and outreach, while I built and integrated the actual hardware and software systems.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>The concept was inspired by RASC-AL’s call for long-term lunar servicing platforms. The arm’s modularity allows for easy upgrades and repairs. We decided to use ROS 2 to support autonomy and communication structure, and I built the entire stack to simulate real-world deployment.</p>

				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Mechanical Design</h3>
				<img src="images/RobotArmRender.jpg" alt="CAD render of the robotic arm">
				<p>We started by analyzing different joint layouts to minimize singularities. I calculated all forces, moments, and required torques based on a desired payload and arm reach. Then, I designed and rapidly prototyped each joint one by one.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>The arm’s structure is built around a 1” x 1” aluminum tube spine, with each joint 3D-printed using PLA, PETG, or ABS depending on stress requirements. I originally designed a 3D-printed harmonic drive to increase torque and reduce backlash, but it was cut due to time. We intended to build all 6 joints and a gripper, but completed J3–J6 + gripper before the deadline.</p>

				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Special Note on J6 + Gripper</h3>
				<img src="images/j6grippercrosssection.png" alt="Cross section of J6 and gripper">
				<p>J6 was an axial joint — we needed >270° rotation, so I geared the potentiometer to achieve ~600° range, using axial thrust bearings and radial bearings. The joint is hollow for wire passthrough to the servo-powered gripper.</p>

				<h3 class="major">Electronics</h3>
				<img src="images/ArmWiringGrosspic.png" alt="Wiring of robotic arm">
				<p>Each joint has its own microcontroller, powered by a shared 4-wire snake (HV+/– and LV+/–). Joints can be added or removed with no changes — they just tap into power and Wi-Fi.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Joint Electronics</summary>
					<img src="images/Joint electronics Diagram.png" alt="Joint electronics diagram">
					<p>Each joint contains an ESP8266, a potentiometer, a motor driver, and a gearmotor. It receives a target angle or velocity, performs PID control, and reports its position via MQTT.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Chassis Electronics</summary>
					<img src="images/robotchassiselectronics.png" alt="Chassis electronics layout">
					<p>The base includes 12V/24V supplies, buck converters, fuse protection, and a Raspberry Pi for control. These hobbyist-grade components were easy to debug and repair.</p>
				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Software & Control</h3>
				<img src="images/RobotArmComsDiagram.png" alt="Comms diagram">
				<p>The robot uses a distributed system: a Raspberry Pi hosts the Wi-Fi and sends MQTT commands to each joint. The Pi supports both velocity and position control modes.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>The Pi runs hostapd, dnsmasq, and mosquitto to create a Wi-Fi network. You SSH in and start a control script. Xbox controllers can drive the robot in velocity mode, or you can use terminal commands in position mode.</p>
				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Communication Protocol</h3>
				<img src="images/Dataexamplepic.png" alt="MQTT data formatting">
				<p>Messages use a consistent bracket format: [DR, DL, J3, J4, J5, J6, G]. The system distinguishes controller input (velocities), desired targets (positions), and actual angles (feedback).</p>

				<h3 class="major">ESP Logic</h3>
				<img src="images/j5 data pic.png" alt="ESP logic data example">
				<p>Each ESP joins Wi-Fi, listens for its command, executes it with PID, and returns its angle to the Pi.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>Supports both 'P45.0' for position and 'V0.6' for velocity. Also includes soft stops to prevent out-of-bounds behavior.</p>
				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Prototyping & Assembly</h3>
				<p>Since joints are modular, each was built, flashed, tuned, and tested independently — avoiding integration issues. We worked from gripper backward to J3.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>The software could run with any number of joints. Internal routing and quick-swap mounting allowed for rapid hardware iteration.</p>
				</details>

				<h3 class="major">Takeaways & Future Work</h3>
				<p>LuMAR is now a Drexel teaching tool. I wrote full documentation for future teams to expand the system.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>More Info</summary>
					<p>Future work includes: adding J1/J2, improving drivetrain, developing new end-effectors, and extending ROS 2 autonomy.</p>
