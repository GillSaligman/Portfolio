      <h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
      <p>Inspired by NASA's RASC-AL challenge, my senior design team created a lunar maintenance rover featuring a modular advanced manipulator, a custom chassis, and distributed control built for adaptability, repairability, and upgradeability.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>The project was built as a proof-of-concept for modularity, control, and systems integration in an academic setting. We created a 7-DOF robotic arm system powered through a 4-wire trunk, with each joint operating independently over Wi-Fi. Every component — mechanical, electrical, and software — was designed from scratch to explore full-stack integration within budget constraints.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="major">Project Highlights</h2>
      <p>I was the team leader responsible for all mechanical design, electrical wiring, firmware, ROS integration, and full prototyping. Our four-person team chose a modular robotic arm as the focus — something serviceable, interchangeable, and upgradeable — rather than attempting a full modular swarm.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>Using RASC-AL’s challenge prompt as inspiration, we brainstormed approaches and selected a modular manipulator that could theoretically function on the Moon for years. After refining that concept, we began prototyping a chassis and advanced arm using ROS2-based communication. The system’s control, integration, and hardware were all built and tested by me.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="major">Mechanical Design</h2>
      <p>We performed simulations to avoid singularities, calculated torques and forces for each joint, and built the arm around a lightweight 1"x1" aluminum skeleton. Each bracket, mount, gear, and bearing interface was custom-designed and 3D-printed in PLA, ABS, or PETG depending on load conditions.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>We initially aimed to use a harmonic drive, but due to time constraints only implemented joints J3 through J7. Each joint uses a potentiometer-based position sensing system. For J6, which required 600°+ motion, we added gearing to the potentiometer, sacrificing precision for range. The design included axial thrust bearings and hollow pathways for internal wire routing to support the gripper servo.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="major">Electronics</h2>
      <p>Each joint contains its own ESP8266 microcontroller, motor driver, and potentiometer, powered through a shared 4-wire bus (HV+/–, LV+/–). This lets joints be removed or added without rewiring or reprogramming.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>We tested several microcontrollers to find affordable, Wi-Fi-capable boards with analog input and MicroPython support. CircuitPython proved unreliable for PID loops, so MicroPython was used instead. The robot also includes off-the-shelf electronics like 12V/24V power supplies, buck converters, fuses, and a Raspberry Pi for central control.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="major">Software & Control</h2>
      <p>The system is controlled through a Raspberry Pi hosting a Wi-Fi network and MQTT broker. A computer connects to the Pi via SSH and runs a main control program that sends desired angles or velocities to each joint, depending on mode.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>The Pi can operate in two modes:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Velocity Mode</strong>: Reads Xbox controller input, formats data as [V+value], and publishes it in a 7-slot array: [DL, DR, J3, J4, J5, J6, J7]</li>
            <li><strong>Position Mode</strong>: Accepts typed commands (e.g., "j3 45") and sends formatted [P45.0] values for specific joints</li>
          </ul>
          Each ESP connects to Wi-Fi, parses its command, converts position to a potentiometer value using regression, and uses PID to reach the target. In velocity mode, motors are driven directly but respect pot-based soft limits.</p>
          <p>Photos and visual breakdowns will be included for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi configuration and network setup</li>
            <li>MQTT communication flow and data types</li>
            <li>ESP32 internal logic and PID structure</li>
          </ul>
        </details>

      <h2 class="major">Prototyping & Assembly</h2>
      <p>To maintain modularity, we validated each joint independently before integration. Because joints don’t depend on each other, we avoided integration hell and could run the system with any subset of joints attached.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>The arm was assembled from the gripper downward (J7 to J3). Each joint was flashed and tested individually, then added to the full system. Our software works with any configuration — for example, with just J6 and J7 operating, the system still handles messaging and feedback correctly. Empty bracket slots disable unused joints.</p>
      </details>

      <h2 class="major">Takeaways & Future Work</h2>
      <p>The robot will be handed off to future Drexel students as an open platform for experimentation and extension — from drivetrain improvement to new end effectors or control schemes.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Details</summary>
        <p>Our controls professor plans to use the platform to demonstrate real-time PID tuning effects. Other students hope to upgrade the chassis, add more joints or grippers, and experiment with tool-changing systems. I prepared detailed documentation, wiring diagrams, and firmware to ensure the system’s longevity as a teaching and prototyping tool.</p>
